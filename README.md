# Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are so cool! 
This repo currently contains a few methods for primaility testing.

## What is a prime number?
A prime number defined as a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
It needs to be greater than 1.

## A Little About Prime Numbers
Research for learning about the properties of Prime Numbers is done for its own sake. There doesn't need to be an apparent need for a practical application because it's trusted that eventually, the rest of our knowledge will catch up, and someone in the future will make a connection and be able to use the knowledge. 

This research has been happening since the ancient Greeks and Egyptions. So, we're more than 3000 years into this expedition and we're stil not close to being done. That's rather inspiring.

## What's Primality Testing?
Given a number, decide if it's prime. Like if we asked someone is 123,871,363 prime? A primality test would be able to answer yes or no to that question. (It's not: 7 x 7 x 7 x 11 x 3,2831 = 123,871,363)

## So What's the big deal?
Prime numbers are the building blocks of all other integers. This means we can create any other positive integer by multiplying prime numbers together. So they're really useful in the field of Cryptography. The little green lock on the URL bar is there thanks in part to prime numbers and all the work other people did for thousands of years to learn about them. Finding new huge prime numbers means we can keep working away on our computers in relative safety and security.
